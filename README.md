This project aims to develop a music recommendation system using machine learning. The objective is to create an app that recommends songs to users based on their inputs, using a machine learning algorithm to identify the most suitable songs. The team will utilize a Kaggle dataset containing over 144,000 songs, each with various traits such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, and tempo. The data will be cleaned through outlier removal, null value/duplicate imputation, and skewness correction. The team will create a Flask API to access the data hosted on a MongoDB Cluster, and the analysis will involve creating data clusters based on the comparison of different traits and classifying by genre. Users will input a song name, artist name, and the number of recommendations they desire on an HTML webpage. The resulting song recommendations will be displayed on the same page, each accompanied by a direct link to the song on Spotify.
